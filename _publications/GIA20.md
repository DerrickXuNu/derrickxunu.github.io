## Abstract
It is extremely challenging to acquire perceptually plausible images under low-light conditions due to low SNR. Most recently,
U-Nets have shown promising results for low-light imaging. However,
vanilla U-Nets generate images with artifacts such as color inconsistency
due to the lack of global color information. In this paper, we propose a
global information aware (GIA) module, which is capable of extracting
and integrating the global information into the network to improve the
performance of low-light imaging. The GIA module can be inserted into
a vanilla U-Net with negligible extra learnable parameters or computational cost. Moreover, a GIA-Net is constructed, trained and evaluated
on a large scale real-world low-light imaging dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed GIA-Net outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods in terms of four metrics, including deep metrics that measure
perceptual similarities. Extensive ablation studies have been conducted
to verify the effectiveness of the proposed GIA-Net for low-light imaging
by utilizing global information.
