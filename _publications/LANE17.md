## Abstract
Automated driving is becoming a reality where HD Map plays an important role in path planning and vehicle localization. Lane boundary
geometry is one of the key components of HD Map. It is typically
created from ground level LiDAR and imagery data, which have
their limitations such as prohibitive cost, infrequent update, traffic
occlusions, and incomplete coverage. In this paper, we propose a
novel method to automatically extract lane information from satellite
imagery using pixel-wise segmentation, which addresses the aforementioned limitations. We will also publish a dataset consists of
satellite imagery and the corresponding lane boundaries as ground
truth to train, test, and evaluate our method.
