## Abstract
Intersection scenarios provide the most complex
traffic situations in Autonomous Driving and Driving Assistance
Systems. Knowing where to stop in advance in an intersection
is an essential parameter in controlling the longitudinal velocity
of the vehicle. Most of the existing methods in literature solely
use cameras to detect stop lines, which is typically not sufficient
in terms of detection range. To address this issue, we propose
a method that takes advantage of fused multi-sensory data
including stereo camera and lidar as input and utilizes a carefully
designed convolutional neural network architecture to detect stop
lines. Our experiments show that the proposed approach can
improve detection range compared to camera data alone, works
under heavy occlusion without observing the ground markings
explicitly, is able to predict stop lines for all lanes and allows
detection at a distance up to 50 meters.
