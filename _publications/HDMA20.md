## Abstract
The majority of current approaches in autonomous vehicles rely on High-Definition
(HD) maps which detail the road geometry and surrounding area. Yet, this reliance
is one of the obstacles to mass deployment of autonomous vehicles due to poor
scalability of such prior maps. In this paper, we tackle the problem of online road
map extraction via leveraging the sensory system aboard the vehicle itself. To this
end, we design a structured model where a graph representation of the road network
is generated in a hierarchical fashion within a fully convolutional network. The
method is able to handle complex road topology and does not require a user in the
loop. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in a variety of topological
scenarios.
