## Abstract
Recent research has found that navigation systems usually assume
that all roads are equally safe, directing drivers to dangerous routes,
which led to catastrophic consequences. To address this problem,
this paper aims to begin the process of adding road safety awareness
to navigation systems. To do so, we first created a definition for
road safety that navigation systems can easily understand by adapting well-established safety standards from transportation studies.
Based on this road safety definition, we then developed a machine
learning-based road safety classifier that predicts the safety level
for road segments using a diverse feature set constructed only from
publicly available geographic data. Evaluations in four different
countries show that our road safety classifier achieves satisfactory
performance. Finally, we discuss the factors to consider when extending our road safety classifier to other regions and potential
new safety designs enabled by our road safety predictions.
