# About Me
* I am currently a PhD candidate at [UCLA Mobility Lab](https://mobility-lab.seas.ucla.edu/). My main focus is on Autonmous Driving and Cooperative Driving Automation.
* Before joining UCLA, I was a Senior Deep Learning Engineer at [Mercedes-Benz R&D North America](https://mbrdna.com/). My main focus was on sensor fusion for Autonomous Driving, online HD Map learning, and topological graph learning.
* Before joining MBRDNA, I enjoyed my time working at [OPPO R&D US](https://www.oppo.com/en/), which is one of the largest smartphone companies in the world. During that period, I mainly worked on model compression and computer vision applications on mobile devices.
* I have also worked at several startups in the area of computer vision such as [Aerospec Technology](https://aerospec.us/) and [AlgoFace](https://www.algoface.ai/).
* I received my master degree from [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/). During the graduate study, I have the honor to work with [Prof. Ying Wu](http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~yingwu/) and [Prof. Xin Chen](http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~xinchen/).

# Highlights
* I have a comrehensive understanding of the whole pipeline of deep learning products from designing the algorithms to implementing them on vehicles/smartphones.
* My project Stop Line Detection is an important feature in [Mercedes-Benz Self-driving San Jos√© pilot](https://www.daimler.com/innovation/case/autonomous/pilot-city-san-jose.html)
* I am very proud to be the major contributor of the commercialized project [Reno2 Ultra Dark Mode](https://oppo.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/8883/~/what-is-ultra-dark-mode-for-reno2%3F). There are more than two millions users benifited from this project!
* I have a great passion for academic research! I spent most of my spare time on research projects and published 7 papers at different ML conferenecs in the past 2 years.

# Academic Services
* Reviewer for AIM at ECCV 2020
* Reviewer for ICIP 2020
